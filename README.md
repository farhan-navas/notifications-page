## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Took the comments from the people who helped me out earlier on frontend mentor and this time tried to incorporate more semantic tags in my html. Was trying out a beginner project for fun and to see if I still remembered vanilla JS as I have been spending time learning React. From this I have learnt, that my command of JS still requires alot of improvement and I have to spend more time improving my CSS styling. However, done in less than half a day so nevertheless still pleased with my improvement!

### Continued development

I have been unable to make my page respond according to certain breakpoints I have set and I realize that my fundamental understand of media queries might be wrong. Thus, I will be spending time relearning all there is to know about media queries and improve upon this project such that it incorporates mobile-first workflow.
